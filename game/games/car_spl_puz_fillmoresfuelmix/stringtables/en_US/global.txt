FIZZY FUEL MIX
WARNING: Avoid falling junk, and catch only these organic ingredients. Too much junk turns a Fizzy Fuel into a Messed Up Mix. Three Messed Up Mixes and it's over, Man!

HOW TO PLAY
Help Fillmore make Fizzy Fuels. Use Arrow Keys to move Fillmore's Pitty left and right to catch falling ingredients. Don't catch too much Junk, or Mixes will go Boom!
Watch out! Mixes with too much Junk become Messed Up Mixes. Three Messed Up Mixes and you've Totally Messed Up!
Try to catch Sunflowers. These rare ingredients reduce the Boom Factor in your Mixes and make them less Messed Up.
Only a sponsored racer that's used this fuel can mix it!
